Disease Outbreak Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and documentation for predicting disease outbreaks using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, environmental factors, and socio-economic indicators, the project aims to develop predictive models to identify the likelihood and intensity of disease outbreaks in specific regions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and engineer features relevant to disease outbreaks.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, correlations, and spatial distributions.
Machine Learning Models: Implement various models including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and more.
Evaluation Metrics: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Prediction Visualization: Display predictions on maps and charts for intuitive understanding.
